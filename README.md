# WeatherApplication
This is a simple web based application that I made, in order to learn about APIs. It uses the openweather.org API, to gather information about the weather for a 
specific location. All that needs to be done in order for this to work, is to enter an openweather.org API key in script.js and to launch the application in 
a browser.
